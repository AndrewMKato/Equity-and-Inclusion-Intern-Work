Inclusive Organizations 

We value diversity at UCR, however, there are subtle ways that organizations can culturally 
undermine efforts supporting diversity and inclusion. Below are just four of the characteristics to 
look out for in your units and some suggestions to help counter these characteristics. For more 
information, see Dismantling Racism: A Workbook for Social Change Groups. 

Perfectionism 

Signs of perfectionism include: constant identification of mistakes and shortcomings, conflation of a 
person with their mistake, and consistent failure to address issues with individuals directly. 

Antidotes include: developing a culture of appreciation, focusing on creating a learning environment 
where mistakes are expected and can be corrected, reflecting on past practice in order to improve 
future processes as a whole. 

Sense of Urgency 

Signs of a sense of urgency include: decisions are rushed and non-inclusive, “quick wins” are 
prioritized over long-term goals, too few resources are allocated for the work expected 

Antidotes include: creating inclusive work plans that include both realistic timelines and 
opportunities for inclusive decision-making, creating transparent plans for decisions that must be 
made quickly 

Defensiveness 

Signs of defensiveness include: an organizational structure that protects power rather than 
clarifying the expectations for those who have power, criticism of those in power is seen as a threat, 
lots of energy is spent protecting the feelings of defensive people who are difficult to work with 

Antidotes include: Talking about how defensiveness is a problem, discussing the fear of lost power 
behind defensiveness, and being open about how defensiveness to new ideas hurts your mission 

Fear of Open Conflict 

Signs of fear of open conflict include: conflict is ignored by those in power, those in power blame 
individuals who raise uncomfortable issues for conflict rather than dealing with those issues, raising 
these difficult issues is equated with being impolite or uncivil 

Antidotes include: Use role-play and other empathy-creating 
techniques to determine how to handle conflict, don’t require those who raise the difficult issues to 
do so in “polite” ways and don’t discount problems if you do not like the way that have been 
brought up.
