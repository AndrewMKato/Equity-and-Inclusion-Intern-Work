Inclusive Conversations

A "call out" is a public announcement to an individual or organization that their speech 
or behavior has negative implications or consequences for marginalized groups. Call out 

culture developed on social media as an opportunity for community learning. The tips 
below will help you make the most of the opportunity to learn if you are "called out"


Don't Lash Out

It's normal to feel defensive or threatened, but remember 

that you are the one who has inflicted harm. It is not actually 

harmful if someone points that out. 

Don't Demand a Free Education

Of course, be open to a discussion with the person who has 

critiqued your behavior, but don't insist on a detailed explanation 

of the nature of the harm you've caused. There are lots of free 

resources online to learn more. Such demands are also often 

ways to distract or undermine the other person. 

Don't Assume the Other Person is Easily Offended

It is very stressful speak up about social justice issues and the 

repercussions can be severe. No one likes to be offended or 

to have to address the behavior of others.


Do Own Your Feelings

If you do feel defensive, consider why. Do you feel bad because 

your self-perception has been challenged? Work on that feeling 

yourself rather than trying to make your interlocutor responsible 

for your emotions. 

Do Listen Actively

Being called out is an opportunity to learn, so listen carefully and try 
to understand the nature of the complaint and the perspective of the 
other person. Instead of listening for cracks in the argument that you 
can use to defend yourself, listen to understand.

Do Apologize

A genuine apology is the best way to really show your intentions. 
Avoid phrases that undermine your culpability like "I'm sorry if I 

offended you" and explain how you will try to avoid the 

behavior in the future.
